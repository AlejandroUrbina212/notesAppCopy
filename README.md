# Notes-App

Note taking app inspired by and followed through the Coding in Flow. Written in Kotlin and implements the new androidx libraries. Tried staying loyal to naming and structure of the example application to make it easier to compare and understand.

### Used Tech

  - Kotlin
  - MVVM
  - Room 
  - LiveData
  - ViewModel
  - ListAdapter for animations on data changes


App supports various database queries & swipe to delete function on the RecyclerView. Utilizes recent ListAdapter library to create animations possible on dataset changes.
