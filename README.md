# Notes-App

  - Kotlin
  - MVVM
  - LiveData
  - ViewModel

Note taking app inspired by and followed through the Coding in Flow. Written in Kotlin and implements the new androidx libraries. Tried staying loyal to naming and structure of the example application to make it easier to compare and understand.
